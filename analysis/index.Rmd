## Introduction

This document provides win rate and play rate statistics for Age of Empires 2
DE across different game modes and map types. Credit to
https://aoe2.net/ for providing the data used to generate these statistics. 

## Statistics


```{r, echo = FALSE, results = "asis", message=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
x <- yaml::read_yaml("./data-raw/report_meta.yml")

dplyr::tibble(
    `Links` = paste0("[Link](./report_", names(x), ".html)"),
    `Leadboard` = purrr::map_chr(x, "leaderboard"),
    `Map Classification` = purrr:: map_chr(x, "mapclass"),
    `Lower Elo Inclusion Limit` = purrr::map_dbl(x, "lower_elo")
) %>%
    knitr::kable(align = "cccc")
```

A comparison of naive win rates across the different groups can be found [here](./cross.html).


## Methods

### Confidence Intervals and why they are Important

A common critique you will hear when talking about any statistic is "you can't trust that value, the sample size is too small!". A natural question is then "well how big should the sample size be?" or the equivanelt question of "how much should I trust this statistic given the sample size". This is where confidence intervals come in.

A key thing to realise is that when we create statistics, like win rates, what we are creating are estimates of some true unknown value. Confidence intervals can thus be thought of as the range of values in which the true value is likely to be found in i.e. there is a 95% chance that the true value for the win rate exists within this band. Thoughout these documents the 95% confidence intervals are presented as error bars around the point estimates. More generally speaking, the wider the confidence interval is the less trust we should have in the estimate whilst the narrower the confidence interval is the more trust we should have in the estimate.

Please note that my above description of confidence intervals is designed to give an intuiative sense of what confidence intervals represent, however what I've written isn't stictly correct. If you want to get into the weeds of what they are then please see the Wiki page [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval).

### Naive Win Rates

Naive win rates are calculated by fitting a logistic regression model to each civ's match data independently, i.e.:

$$
Y_{ij} \sim Bin(1, p_{ij}) \\
p_i = \text{logistic}(\beta_i +  \beta_d d_{j})
$$

Where: 

- $Y_{ij}$ is 1 if civ $i$ won its $j$'th match
- $\beta_i$ is civ $i$'s logit win rate
- $d_j$ is the difference in mean Elo between team 1 and team 2 in match $j$

All mirror matchups are excluded. 

### Averaged Win Rates


Averaged win rates are calculated by taking the average across all civ v civ win rates.
I.e The Aztec win rate is calculated by taking the mean of their win rate vs Berbers, Britons, Bulgarians, etc, separately. This statistic can be thought of as the win rate if your opponent was picking their civilisation at random. 

For 1v1's each civ v civ win rate is calculated using the "naive" method mentioned above. For team games though the win rates are calculated by fitting a logistic regression that derives the probability of winning as the average across each pairwise civilisation matchup.  For example lets say in match $j$ that team 1 had civ's A, B and C whilst team 2 had civ's X, Y and Z. The model fitted would then be:

$$
Y_{j} \sim Bin(1, p_{j}) \\
p_i = \text{logistic}\left(\frac{\beta_{AX} + \beta_{AY} + \beta_{AZ} + \beta_{BX} + \beta_{BY} + \beta_{BZ} + \beta_{CX} + \beta_{CY} + \beta_{CZ}}{9} +  \beta_d d_{j}\right)
$$

Where:

- $Y_j$ = 1 if team 1 won or 0 if team 2 won
- $\beta_{mn}$ is civ $m$'s win rate against civ $n$
- $d_j$ is the difference in mean Elo between team 1 and team 2

Please note that a major limitation of this formulation is that it doesn't allow for any interaction effects. I.e. it doesn't account for the fact that some civ pairings are stronger together than if they are considered independently (think a team of all cav civs vs a team of both archer and cav civs).

In all cases, a small Laplace Smoother was added to avoid issues associated with certainty bias from civ v civ samples (most notabily in the Empire Wars data). This will mean that the confidence are very marginally underestimated but realistically this is negligible.


## Frequently Asked Questions & Critiques

The following are common critiques and questions I see with regards to assessing civilisation win rate statistics along with my personal opinion / response towards them.

<br/>

**1) You shouldn't include games with players below an Elo of X as the civilisation is nowhere near as important as other factors such as their overall understanding of the game and are likely making a ton of mistakes which don't reflect the civilisations overall ability / balance.**

I have two main objections to this argument, the first being more statistical in nature and the other being my personal feelings towards what it means to "balance" a game. 

So my first argument is that just because civilisation is less important that player skill doesn't mean that these games don't have value. Fundamentally the low Elo just means there is more noise in the data and that it's harder to pick out the signal. However this does NOT mean that the data is useless and we should disregard it. It just means we need more of it in order to identify the effects of the choice of civilisation.

My second argument is that I don't think it is sensible to just balance the game based upon the pros / perfect play of a civilisation; I strongly believe we should strive to ensure the game is balanced across all levels of gameplay. As an extreme example let's imagine we have a civ that completely dominates and is oppressive at Elos <= 1500 but that the pros are easily able to counter with pixel perfect micro. Would you consider this balanced just because the pros are fine with it even though it breaks the game for the vast vast majority of players ? Alas I feel it is important to assess and strive for balance across all levels of play and not just at the top levels. 

<br/>

**2) You need to account for players who play the vast majority of their games as a single civilisation**

This is a fair critique; play rates do have a large impact on the win rates. See some of my [earlier work](https://www.reddit.com/r/aoe2/comments/pl4jpz/a_brief_look_at_the_impact_of_civ_picking_on_win/) to get an idea of how they are impacted. That being said the main impact appears to be a regression towards having a neutral 50% win rate so it is likely that the most played civ's have their win rate underestimated (I'm looking at you Franks). I am hoping at a later date to try and filter the data down to players who play random however I fear there is unlikely to be sufficient data to generate any meaningful statistics.
